        Samples the radio material

        This function samples an interaction type (e.g., specular reflection,
        diffuse reflection or refraction) and direction of propagation for the
        scattered ray, and returns the corresponding radio material sample and Jones matrix.
        The returned radio material sample stores the sampled type of interaction and sampled direction
        of propagation of the scattered ray.

        The following assumptions are made on the inputs:

        - ``ctx.component`` is a binary mask that specifies the types of interaction enabled. Booleans can be obtained from this mask as follows:

        .. code-block:: python

            specular_reflection_enabled = (ctx.component & InteractionType.SPECULAR) > 0
            diffuse_reflection_enabled = (ctx.component & InteractionType.DIFFUSE) > 0
            transmission_enabled = (ctx.component & InteractionType.TRANSMISSION) > 0

        - ``si.wi`` is the direction of propagation of the incident wave in the world frame
        - ``si.sh_frame`` is the frame such that the ``sh_frame.n`` is the normal to the intersected surface in the world coordinate system
        - ``si.dn_du`` stores the real part of the S and P components of the incident electric field represented in the implicit world frame (first and second components of ``si.dn_du``)
        - ``si.dn_dv`` stores the imaginary part of the S and P components of the incident electric field represented in the implicit world frame (first and second components of ``si.dn_dv``)
        - ``si.dp_du`` stores the solid angle of the ray tube (first component of ``si.dn_du``)

        The outputs are set as follows:

        - ``bs.wo`` is the direction of propagation of the sampled scattered ray in the world frame
        - ``jones_mat`` is the Jones matrix describing the transformation incurred to the incident wave in the implicit world frame

    r"""
    Class implementing a path solver

    A path solver computes propagation paths between the antennas of
    all transmitters and receivers in the a scene.
    For each propagation path :math:`i`, the corresponding channel coefficient
    :math:`a_i` and delay :math:`\tau_i`, the
    angles of departure :math:`(\theta_{\text{T},i}, \varphi_{\text{T},i})`
    and arrival :math:`(\theta_{\text{R},i}, \varphi_{\text{R},i})`, as
    well as the Doppler shifts :math:`f_{\Delta, i}` are computed.
    For more detail, see :eq:`H_final`.
    This path solver currently supports line-of-sigth, specular and diffuse
    reflection, as well as refraction. Paths can consist of any of these interaction
    types, in any order.
    Different propagation phenomena can be individually enabled/disabled.

    This solver assumes that materials are thin enough that their effect on
    transmitted rays (i.e., rays that traverse the materials through double
    refraction) is negligible. Rays are traced without angular deflection, and
    objects like walls should be modeled as single flat surfaces having an
    attached radio material that accounts for their
    :attr:`~sionna.rt.RadioMaterial.thickness`.
    This approach may be inaccurate for very thick objects.
    The figure below illustrates this model, where :math:`E_i` is the
    incident electric field, :math:`E_r` is the reflected field and :math:`E_t` is
    the transmitted field. The Jones matrices, :math:`\mathbf{R}(d)` and
    :math:`\mathbf{T}(d)`, represent the effects of reflection and transmission,
    respectively, and depend on the slab thickness, :math:`d`.

    If synthetic arrays are used (``synthetic_array`` is `True`), transmitters
    and receivers are modelled as if they had a single antenna located at their
    :attr:`~sionna.rt.RadioDevice.position`. The channel responses for each
    individual antenna of the arrays are then computed "synthetically" by applying
    appropriate phase shifts. This reduces the complexity significantly
    for large arrays. Time evolution of the channel coefficients can be simulated with
    using :meth:`~sionna.rt.Paths.cir` and :meth:`~sionna.rt.Paths.cfr` methods  of the returned
    :class:`~sionna.rt.Paths` object.
